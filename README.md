Understanding the Gaming Behavior of Adults

This study explores the gaming behaviors of adults, a group of people aged 18 or above. The aim is to identify an adultâ€™s gaming behavior as concerning or non-concerning and evaluate its association with a range of symptoms related to psychological, social, and physical health. The study also investigates the motives, preferences, and effects of gaming on adults through a combination of quantitative survey data and qualitative insights from various research papers.

Features
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms on a newly created dataset from Bangladeshi participants.
Behavior Classification: Classifies concerning and non-concerning gaming behaviors based on gaming frequency and total gaming hours.
Awareness: Helps raise awareness about gaming behaviors before they lead to negative health issues or concerning daily routines.
Future Goals: Plans to include more parameters for accurate findings, collect more data, apply additional machine learning models, and use clustering algorithms to identify patterns in the data.
